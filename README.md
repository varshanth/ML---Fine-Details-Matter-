# Machine (and Deep) Learning: Fine Details Matter!

Understanding machine (and deep) learning concepts from can be challenging. It can be even more challenging to people who just can't accept stated facts which they don't understand. This repo contains a list of resources that I referred to when I was seeking for the "right" words/representations to comprehend certain topics. The list certainly isn't exhaustive nor is it meant to cover the basic understanding of any concept (there are abundant resources for that), although it might. In my opinion, the effectiveness of a resource is, how convincing it can be to those people who cannot easily get convinced. The path to convincing your brain about ML & DL concepts (poetically not by a coincidence) is to use the concepts themselves; iteratively train your brain with a lot of effective resources (revisit them persistently) til you are convinced (convergence at last!) and carry the knowledge you gained by them to the next challenge. I sincerely thank the authors of these resources as they have made me comprehend conceptual fragments (if not the entirety) and hence cementing my foundation in these topics.
