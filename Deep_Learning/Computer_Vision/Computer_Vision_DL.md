3) Accuracy  
4 Guidelines:  
1) Equal Channel Width Reduces MAC  
2) Excessive Group Convolution Increases MAC  
3) Network Fragmentation (Blocks of multiple small convolution ops) reduces parallelism  
4) Elementwise Ops have High MAC

### Evaluation Metric: mean Average Precision (mAP)  
* Read until (excluding) Interpolated Precision [Their toy example is wrong]:  
https://towardsdatascience.com/breaking-down-mean-average-precision-map-ae462f623a52
* Should make things crystal clear:  
https://medium.com/@jonathan_hui/map-mean-average-precision-for-object-detection-45c121a31173  
* Good visualization of PR curves because all the above toy examples give the ideal scenario when recall of 1.0 can actually be achieved. This will give a good visualization of realistic recall values at higher IoU thresholds:  
https://medium.com/@timothycarlen/understanding-the-map-evaluation-metric-for-object-detection-a07fe6962cf3  

In summary:

1) Take predictions of a certain class  
2) Filter out the predictions lower than the IoU threshold "T"  
3) Sort the remaining predictions in descending order of the class confidence (softmax) values  
4) Calculate the AP  
5) Perform Steps 1) to 4) for all classes  
6) Take average across all classes to get the mAP@T

## Transpose Convolutions

* Use as basics to calculate output:  
https://d2l.ai/chapter_computer-vision/tranposed-conv.html  
* A solid way to view convolutions and hence transpose convolutions:  
https://medium.com/activating-robotic-minds/up-sampling-with-transposed-convolution-9ae4f2df52d0  
* Visual learning -> Work these out on your own:  
https://medium.com/apache-mxnet/transposed-convolutions-explained-with-ms-excel-52d13030c7e8  
* Master guide to convolution arithmetic:  
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.07285.pdf  

* Note: When you want to understand the striding in transpose convolutions, the visualizations in the above links use zeros between the input values so that it can be visualized with normal transpose convolutions with stride 1. This visualization does NOT mean to convolve the kernel with the input values in parallel i.e. you will never somehow combine 2 input values to multiply against the kernel. It should be rather interpreted as a sequential multiplication of 1 input value at a time with the entire kernel, then going to the next. In this way, when you reach the 0 in between 2 input values, you are only multiplying the entire kernel with all 0s.  
Think of it like (USE RAW FORMAT TO VISUALIZE):  
  
  I  0   I  0   I   0   I  0  I  
              / x \  
           K e r n e l
